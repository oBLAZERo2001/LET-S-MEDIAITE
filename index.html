                <h1>Advantages</h1>
                <h2>1. Better focus and concentration</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness meditation helps you focus on the present, which can improve your concentration on other tasks in daily life. A 2011 study from the Harvard Medical School examined the effects of mindfulness meditation on the brain and found
                    a connection between mindfulness and processing new information. The researchers examined the brains of 17 people before and after participating in an eight-week meditation program. Brain scans showed an increase in gray matter in
                    the parts of the brain responsible for learning, memory, and emotional regulation. Additionally, a 2016 study from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University demonstrated how mindfulness meditation can improve concentration and decision
                    making. The study consisted of 35 unemployed adults looking for work. One group participated in a three-day relaxation program without mindfulness meditation components, while the other group participated in three days of mindfulness
                    meditation. Brain scans before and after showed an increase in connectivity among parts of the brain that control attention for the meditation group. "Research shows we can actually train our attention and our meta-awareness, and that
                    this is a learnable skill," says Richard Davidson, PhD, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds. .</p>
                <h2>2. Improve self-esteem and self-awareness</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness meditation encourages you to slow down, allows for deeper self-reflection, and can help you discover positive attributes about yourself. "Mindfulness helps increase self-awareness by increasing the ability to examine one's
                    thoughts and feelings without judgment, which ends up improving self-esteem," says Brian Wind, PhD, Chief Clinical Officer at JourneyPure. According to researchers at Stanford University, mindfulness meditation can especially help
                    those with social anxiety. In a 2009 study published in the Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy, 14 participants with social anxiety disorder participated in two months of meditation training and reported decreased anxiety and improved
                    self-esteem after completing the program.</p>
                <h2>3. Reduce stress</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness meditation can also lower the levels of cortisol — the stress hormone —which helps you feel more relaxed. In a 2013 review, researchers analyzed more than 200 studies of mindfulness meditation among healthy people and found
                    meditation to be an effective way to reduce stress. Repeating a mantra — such as a word or phrase — during meditation can also have a calming effect, and by concentrating on your mantra, you're able to shift your focus away from distracting
                    thoughts. Transcendental meditation has a similar effect, in which you silently repeat a word or sound to keep yourself focused, and as a result you're able to reach a state of complete stillness and stability, says David Foley, founder
                    of Unify Cosmos, a meditation center in Oklahoma. For example, a 2019 study showed a reduction in psychological distress among teachers and support staff who participated in a transcendental meditation program. Researchers used stress
                    scales before and after the program to measure the participants' levels of burnout, depression, and stress. After receiving a seven-step transcendental meditation course, participants practiced meditation twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes
                    over the course of four months and reported lower levels of stress and burnout than before learning the techniques. </p>
